👋 Hi, I’m @Avazkhon-IMS, a PhD student at the Institute of Materials Science of Uzbekistan with a passion for pushing the boundaries of materials science through advanced computational techniques.

👀 I’m deeply interested in the application of Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations to explore and optimize photocatalytic materials. My goal is to uncover new insights into the quantum behavior of materials that can lead to innovative applications in energy, environmental science, and beyond.

🌱 I’m currently expanding my knowledge in both the theoretical underpinnings and computational methodologies of DFT calculations. This journey is about diving deeper into computational materials science, with a focus on how quantum mechanics can predict and explain material properties at the atomic level.

💞️ I’m eager to collaborate with fellow researchers, academics, and anyone passionate about materials science and computational chemistry. Whether it's exploring new materials, refining computational methods, or discussing theoretical concepts, I believe in the power of collaboration to accelerate discovery.

📫 How to reach me: Feel free to connect with me via email at avazkhon1996@gmail.com or follow me on LinkedIn for updates on my research and collaborations. Your ideas, questions, and proposals for joint projects are always welcome!

😄 Pronouns: He/Him

⚡ Fun fact: Outside of my research, I enjoy exploring the vast landscapes of Uzbekistan, which not only offers a break from the computational work but also inspires me with its natural beauty and the intricate patterns found in nature, reminding me of the complex structures I study.
